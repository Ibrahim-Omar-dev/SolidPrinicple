# SolidPrinicple
ðŸ”§ SOLID Principles Refactoring Project
This project demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of applying the SOLID Principles in object-oriented design.

ðŸ“Œ What is SOLID?
SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that help developers design software that is easy to maintain and extend:

S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

âœ… Project Objective
The goal of this project is to show a side-by-side comparison of classes written before and after applying SOLID principles, highlighting how clean architecture improves maintainability, flexibility, and scalability.

ðŸ“˜ Example Highlights
Before Applying SOLID:

-Classes with multiple responsibilities
-Hard-coded dependencies making unit testing difficul
-Tightly coupled components preventing code reuse
-Difficult to extend or modify without changing existing code

After Applying SOLID:

-Single Responsibility: Each class has one job
-Open/Closed: Classes are open for extension but closed for modification
-Liskov Substitution: Subclasses can replace base classes without breaking the application
-Interface Segregation: Clients only depend on what they use
-Dependency Inversion: High-level modules donâ€™t depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions

ðŸŽ¯ Benefits Observed
-Easier unit testing and mocking
-Better separation of concerns
-Improved readability and maintainability
-Code is more modular and reusable

ðŸ’¡ Conclusion
This project serves as a clear demonstration of how applying the SOLID principles can lead to better software design. Refactoring legacy code with these principles improves the quality, testability, and longevity of applications.
